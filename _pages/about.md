Yongzhi Li is a master student at the Machine Intelligence lab of Peking University, Beijing China. He is majored in computer vision and deep learning. His research work mainly involves in Steganograph, Medical AI, Cross modality retrieval and Image captioning. He received his bachelor's degree in computer science from the School of Computer Science in Wuhan University, Wuhan China.

<!-- Junqing Zhang is a Tenure Track Fellow (Assistant Professor) at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Electronics, the University of Liverpool, UK from Feb. 2018. His work mainly involves designing innovative and practical physical layer security solutions for future wireless technologies with ultra-low energy requirements but high security standards. He has been investigating wireless security solutions for a number of Internet of Things techniques, including IEEE 802.11a/g/ax, LoRa/LoRaWAN, ZigBee, etc, with a focus on the physical and MAC layers. -->

<!-- He was a Postdoc Research Fellow at Queen’s University Belfast, UK from Feb. 2016 to Jan. 2018. He received the PhD degree in Electronics and Electrical Engineering from Queen’s University Belfast, UK in Jan. 2016. His detailed education background and work experience can be found in [Education and Work](/edu-work-experience/) -->
