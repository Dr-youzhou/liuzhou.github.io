I have developed a strong research potential in innovative computer vision application and deep learning algorithm.
My current research mainly focuses on fine-grained cross-modal retrieval and matching, including the mining of higher-order and complex semantic information and some hashing related work. 
My research interests also include the application of AI technology in the medical field and other security and privacy-related applications like video steganography.
 <!-- My research aims to bridge the gap between the theoretical modelling and practical exploitation of physical layer security using state-of-the-art testbeds and equipment. -->
<!-- In particular, my research aims to ensure the secure connection using key generation and device authentication using radio frequency fingerprint identification. -->

## Cross-Modal Retrieval/Matching
* Key generation is an emerging technique to establish cryptographic keys between legitimate users by extracting randomness from their common channels.

## Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) Identification
* All the components of wireless devices will have slightly different features, e.g., carrier frequency of the oscillators, from the manufacturing processing. Similar to biometric fingerprint, these characteristics are unique and permanent, which can act as the fingerprint of the devices. This technique first requires collecting the device fingerprint and storing them in a database, and then classifies devices by comparing with the stored database whenever a device wishes to join the network.
